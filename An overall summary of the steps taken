Data Preparation and Preprocessing:

Initially, the dataset consists of 5180 employees, and the objective is to predict attrition rates for 2630 employees.
'Testdata' values are inserted into the Attrition column for the Test_Dataset.
Test and Train data are merged for analysis.
The data is categorized into Numeric and Categorical variables for preprocessing.

Numeric Variables:

Age: Null values are filled with the average of Mean and Median rounded off to 37.
Distance from home to work: Null values are filled with Mean + Median / 2, rounded off to 10.
Hours in a week: Null values are filled with the Median.
NumCompaniesWorked: Null values are filled with the Median.
SalaryHikelastYear: Null values are filled with the Median.
WorkExperience: Null values are filled with the average of Mean and Median rounded off to 11.
LastPromotion: Null values are filled with the Mean rounded off to 2.
Current Profile: Null values are filled with 4, rounded off after the average of Mean and Median.
MonthlyIncome: Null values are filled with the average of Mean and Median rounded off to 20983.

Categorical Variables:

Department: Null values are filled proportionately among the existing values, with 2 extra values added to Analytics.
Gender: Null values are filled proportionately among Male and Female categories.
Designation: Null values are filled proportionately among different designations.
'Involvement' and 'WorkLifeBalance' are ordinal variables and are encoded accordingly.

Feature Scaling and Multicollinearity Check:

Columns 'Attrition', 'Designation_Executive', 'EducationField_Statistics', and 'Department_Sales' are dropped from the test data because of high VIF, indicating multicollinearity between these variables.
Feature scaling is performed on the numeric variables using the same scaler fitted on the training data before model building

Encoding:

The least frequent value in each category is considered for dropping.
For 'MaritalStatus', 'Divorsed' is changed to 'Divorced' and 'M' is added to 'Married'.

Model Building and Evaluation:

Training and validation data are split into features and target, with a test size of 0.2, a random state of 89, and stratification based on the target.
Twelve models are constructed, including Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Algorithm, XGBoost, Bagging Classifier, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes Theorem, Decision Tree, Voting Classifier, and Stacking Classifier.
Model evaluation includes confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores.

Results:

Logistic Regression: Accuracy - 82.05%
AdaBoost: Accuracy - 82.14%
Gradient Boosting Algorithm: Accuracy - 88.80%
XGBoost: Accuracy - 99.23%
Bagging Classifier: Accuracy - 98.17%
Random Forest: Accuracy - 98.84%
K Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy - 94.59%
Support Vector Machine: Accuracy - 92.28%
Naive Bayes Theorem: Accuracy - 79.15%
Decision Tree: Accuracy - 95.85%
Voting Classifier: Accuracy - 94.79%
Stacking Classifier: Accuracy - 99.32%

Test Data Summary:

Columns 'Attrition', 'Designation_Executive', 'EducationField_Statistics', and 'Department_Sales' are dropped from the test data.
Predictions are made using each loaded model on the scaled test data.
Predictions from each model are stored in a DataFrame.
Predictions are exported to an Excel file named 'model_predictions_final.xlsx'.

Conclusion:

Overall, the project involves extensive data preprocessing, encoding, and model building to predict attrition rates, with impressive accuracies achieved by various machine learning algorithms.
According to the Logistic Regression model, it is predicted that out of the 2630 employees analyzed, approximately 544 employees are expected to experience attrition.


The findings have been effectively represented in a Power BI format.
